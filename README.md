# A New Spoon

This project is step one of a long saga of projects. The main goal is to redesign SpoonUniversity into a clearer format and cooler setup.
Unfortunately it took forever to figure out the kinks and what-ifs so no one really knows about it

Also this has been delayed previously twice now due to unforeseen life problems.

Feel free to spread the word of this redesign.
