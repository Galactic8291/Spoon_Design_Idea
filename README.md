# Spoon Design Numero Uno

Okay so after a long time being spent of at looking at this. I realized to go back to the drawing boards and work on few things that I have learned in my development cycle. This project was fun but I demand better standards. And alot more specificity in the details. I feel this was a good start and have decided to deprecate this good lad of a repo. I have moved to a new spot along with the name so its easy to find https://github.com/TheGalacticNinja/A_New_Spoon. There made it easier!!!

Also the tasklist on my readme has been abandoned. Feel free to hit me up in the issues if you wanna be in on the tasklist.

Welp this is a final goodbye to a good Repo. 
Rest in Github!
