# A New Spoon

This project is step one of a long saga of projects. The main goal is to redesign SpoonUniversity into a clearer format and cooler setup.
Unfortunately it took forever to figure out the kinks and what-ifs so no one really knows about it

Also this has been delayed previously twice now due to unforeseen life problems.

Feel free to spread the word of this redesign.

Rule 1): DO NOT GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF

Rule 2): DO NOT FORGET TO UPDATE TASK

Rule 3): DO NOT MAKE CHANGES IN MASTER EVER AGAIN
